## 📌 Overview

**Contract Summarizer** helps procurement, legal, and logistics teams automatically:
- 🔍 Summarize long vendor and logistics contracts
- 📜 Extract key clauses (e.g. Payment Terms, Delivery Timelines, SLA)
- 🚩 Flag risky or missing clauses
- 💬 Optionally chat with the contract using natural language

This significantly reduces onboarding time, legal oversight, and manual review across Walmart's supply chain.
